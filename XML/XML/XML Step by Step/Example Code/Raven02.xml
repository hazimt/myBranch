   <VERSE>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</VERSE>
   <VERSE>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore&#8212;</VERSE>
   <VERSE>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</VERSE>
   <VERSE>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</VERSE>
   <VERSE>"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door&#8212;</VERSE>
   <VERSE>Only this, and nothing more."</VERSE>

   <VERSE>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,</VERSE>
   <VERSE>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</VERSE>
   <VERSE>Eagerly I wished the morrow;&#8212;vainly I had sought to borrow</VERSE>
   <VERSE>From my books surcease of sorrow&#8212;sorrow for the lost Lenore&#8212;</VERSE>
   <VERSE>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore&#8212;</VERSE>
   <VERSE>Nameless here for evermore.</VERSE>
