   <VERSE>I SING the Body electric;</VERSE>
   <VERSE>The armies of those I love engirth me, and I engirth them;</VERSE>
   <VERSE>They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,</VERSE>
   <VERSE>And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the Soul.</VERSE>   
</STANZA>
<STANZA>
   <VERSE>Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves;</VERSE>
   <VERSE>And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?</VERSE>   
   <VERSE>And if the body does not do as much as the Soul?</VERSE>   
   <VERSE>And if the body were not the Soul, what is the Soul?</VERSE>
