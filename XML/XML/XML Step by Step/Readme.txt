HOW TO USE THE CD
=================

Autorun CD Menu
---------------

To start using this companion disc, insert it into your CD-ROM drive. If 
Autorun is disabled on your system, run StartCD.exe in the root directory 
of the CD to launch the start menu. The menu provides you with an interface to 
all of the resources available on the CD, including access to comprehensive 
Web support from Microsoft Press. 


Example files for the book
--------------------------

The source files given in the numbered listings in the book (as well as the
supplemental graphics files) are included on this CD in the \Example Code folder. 
To copy all of the example files to your hard disk, select the Install Example 
Code and Resource Links setup option and follow the instructions that appear 
on the screen. The samples require less than 1 MB of hard disk space.

To uninstall the sample files, make the appropriate selection from Add/Remove
Programs in Control Panel.

For more information, please see the "Using the Companion CD" section in the 
book's Introduction.


Resource links for the book
---------------------------

A large number of on-line resources are identified throughout the book. These 
resources are summarized in the Appendix, which is available on this CD in HTML 
for linking to the resource on the World Wide Web. This HTML file is installed 
on your computer along with the example files by selecting the Install Example 
Code and Resource Links setup option.


To uninstall the resource links, make the appropriate selection from Add/Remove
Programs in Control Panel. (This will also uninstall the example files.)

For more information, please see the "Using the Companion CD" section in the 
book's Introduction.


Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01
--------------------------------

A U.S. English version of Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 has been included on 
this CD in the \MSIE501 folder. To launch the install screen for Internet
Explorer 5 and the Internet Tools, select the Install Internet Explorer 5.01 
setup option.


Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5
-------------------------------

As this book goes to print, Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 is in Beta test. 
The Beta version of the code is available for download at

http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie

Once the Internet Explorer page is displayed, enter "Internet Explorer 5.5" 
into the Search box and click the Search button. Select the 'Internet Explorer 
5.5 and Internet Tools Beta' entry from the Search Results list. Note 
Microsoft's comments regarding the wisdom of installing any Beta code on 
critical systems.

When the official release becomes available, you will be able to 
download it directly from the Internet Explorer page.



SUPPORT INFORMATION
===================

Troubleshooting
---------------


* Long file names on CD and 16-bit CD-ROM drives: 

If you have an older, 16-bit CD-ROM drive and you browse the CD, 
you will not see long filenames on folders or files. Contact your CD-ROM 
drive manufacturer for information and the latest driver updates. 


* Manually copying files from CD-ROM

If you manually copy the example files from the CD-ROM to your hard disk, you might
need to remove each file's read-only attribute in order to use the file. To
do so, right-click the file in a Windows Explorer window and click Properties in the
context menu. On the General tab, clear the Read-only check box in the 
Attributes section. Click OK.
