Important notes
Case Problem 4
• The tutorial asks you to create XML files from text content provided. To make the work a little
bit easier for you, I created those files. You can skip step 1 of the tutorial. The files are posted in
the Assignment 4 folder in case4.zip file.

• Please do step 2, draw the diagrams, using any software you like. I use PowerPoint. You can
borrow my file jazz_tree_diagram.pptx from Week 2 folder to start your work with it. Please
make sure the diagrams you submit are in some common file format -- PDF or JPG or ppt. This
will allow me to open and grade your files.

• In step 5 the book tells you to use external entities. That means using DTDs. You do not have to
do it the way the book suggests. Just combine 3 XML documents: books, movies, and music in
one document by copying-pasting all the elements including roots with the namespace
attributes.
