How to Build Test Automation from Scratch? A Top-Down Approach

Phase I - Pre-execution:
A - What is your business model?

B - Set your objectives

C - Define channel with manual testing
	1) Test Case Generation & Handshake:
	2) Test Case Validation:
	3) Test Results Validation:


D - Get input from stakeholders



E - Plan test automation integration into existing process


F - Research your tool set



Phase II - Implementation:

A - Define the development process
B - Design it
	1) The Architecture Design
		Model the architecture in mirror to application-under-test
		
		Create helper methods

		Separate test data - And design it

		Separate files for configurations and environments

		
D - Automate 
	Develop independent tests

	Everything is an object

	Every scenario has a unique identifier

	
Phase III - Maintenance & Evolution
	Application-under-test Code Coverage by test automation

	Bugs discovered by automation vs. Manual QA

	Manual execution time (per test case)

	Automated test script development time

	Automated test script maintenance time
